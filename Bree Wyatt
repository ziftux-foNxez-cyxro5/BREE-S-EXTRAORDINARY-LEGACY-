I’m 26 years old a single mother of three. Upcoming Beautician and this is something im very passionate about, I'm still learning things including nails, makeup, facials and making wigs. My goal is to eventually open up my own shop I’m trying to leave a legacy for my kids. Even if you don’t want to switch hairstylist then a little support is all I ask for.
